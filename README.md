# Max Damage: Crisis Mode

This is our entry into the JS13k Games 2021 competition.
You can play the game here: https://js13kgames.com/entries/max-damage-crisis-mode
You can see a video playthrough of the game here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G27VAhcDIYA
The game was made with our JS13K Games Asset Engine available here: https://github.com/roblouie/js13k-asset-engine

Both the game and the asset engine were made in about 28 days during the competition, so the asset engine is a bit rough around the edges. 
However, you can run the asset engine (or go to https://roblouie.com/game-engine/#/) and click Choose File in the upper left, load the a.a file included in the game
and see all the art, music, and levels for the game, and even edit them to mod the game. Just click "save assets" and replace the a.a file with the one you saved
and the game will have any changes you make.
