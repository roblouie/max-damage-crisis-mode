##Golfin'
The code needs to be smaller, smaller than even closure compiler makes it. So it's time to be dumb.

###`use strict` Doesn't let you just yeet variables into existence

###Built in Method Replacing
Built in methods have long names that tell you what they do. This is bad. So give them all new 
names that are short and tell you nothing.
